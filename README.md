## Tech Stack

Moflix utilizes the following technologies:

- Flutter: Flutter is a powerful cross-platform framework for building beautiful and high-performance applications. It allows for the creation of visually appealing user interfaces and enables seamless development for both iOS and Android platforms.
- HTTP: The HTTP package is used for making API calls and handling network requests in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of fetching data from external sources, such as the TMDB API in the case of Moflix.
- flutter_bloc: flutter_bloc is a state management library for Flutter applications that follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architectural pattern. It helps to separate business logic from the user interface, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
- sqflite: sqflite is a Flutter package that provides a simple and efficient way to interact with SQLite databases. In Moflix, it is used to store and retrieve locally cached data, such as user favorites or previously viewed movies and TV series.
- google_fonts: google_fonts is a Flutter package that simplifies the integration of custom fonts from the Google Fonts collection. It allows for easy customization of typography in the app, enhancing the visual experience.
- bloc_test: bloc_test is a package that provides utilities for testing BLoC components in Flutter applications. It enables writing unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the app's business logic.

## Architecture

Moflix follows the Clean Architecture principles. It promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by dividing the codebase into layers: presentation, domain, and data. This architecture allows for easier testing, modularity, and scalability of the application.

## Data Source

Moflix utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) API as its primary data source. The API provides a vast collection of movie and TV series information, including details, ratings, genres, and trailers. By integrating with the TMDB API, Moflix ensures an up-to-date and comprehensive catalog of movies and TV shows.
